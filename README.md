# Coordinates-Converter
# I needed to convert coordinates with format DEG MIN SEC, to decimal
# Sometimes I had 10-20 coordinates in excel and needed to quickly convert them all
# So this uses Pandas to read an excel file (i.e. a Template), parse the coordinates and then
# write back to a fresh excel sheet and put the date in the filename as well
